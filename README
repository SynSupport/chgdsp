SUBMISSION NAME:    CHGDSP
  
PLATFORM:	    VMS v5.5-2 or higher

SYNERGY VERSION:    Synergy v5.7.9 or higher

DESCRIPTION:	    VMS - Migrating from DISPLAY to W_xxxx routines 

 This command file facilitates the migration from DISPLAY statements
 to usage of the W_XXXX routines by changes the following Synergy
 Language elements:

	DISPLAY(		to	XCALL W_DISP(CUR_WINDOW
	$SCR_POS(n1, n1)	to	WD_POS, n1, n2
	$SCR_CLR(?)		to	WD_CLR, ?
	$SCR_ATT(?)		to	WD_ATTR+ATTR_LOAD+?

 Of course, YOU have to put in the XCALL W_PROC statement to CREATE the 
 CUR_WINDOW window, as a default, 24 line, 80 column window, and place 
 it at line 1 column 1

 Usage:

	$@CHGDSP file.dbl
